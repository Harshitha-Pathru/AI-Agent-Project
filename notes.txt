Building AI Agent /Systems using python and Direct LLM API
No external tools used . For automating mundane tasks we go through daily.
Custom data /AI solutions for clients
Underlying principles/Fundamental Principles.
Core Building Blocks

Step 1: Get api_key of respective LLM you want to work with and store it secretly.
Step1.1:Create the llm model object with model specifications and response.
Step 2: Structured Output- Ensure responses adhere to JSON Schema - response should be in JSON format

Why in JSOn format: we can use them in our app programmatically inorder to make decisions to route certain things to get the right system prompt

Step 3: Using tools
Enable models to fetch data and take actions
Step 4: Retrieval
using tools to get data for context
